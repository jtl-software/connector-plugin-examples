## Introduction
This is an example plugins repository for JTL-Connector plugins. All plugins from this repository can be used and adapted as you need it. But there is no guarantee that the plugins will work. And there will be no support from JTL-Software GmbH as well. If you need help, you can hire a developer or ask the community in the JTL-Connector forum.
